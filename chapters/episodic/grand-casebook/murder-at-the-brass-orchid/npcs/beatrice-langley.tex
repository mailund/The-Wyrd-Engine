    \subsubsection*{Background:}
    Beatrice Langley built a reputation as one of the Brass Orchid’s most sought-after hostesses, but her true past is far less glamorous. Once entangled in dangerous affairs, she sought refuge in the club’s gilded halls, only to have her secrets catch up with her. When Edward Mercer threatened to expose her, she took the only way out she saw—murder.
