\subsection{Act 0: Into the Fray}

At the Game Master's discretion, the summons to the \textbf{Grand Hall} may be role-played, allowing players to experience firsthand how the \textbf{Grand Society of Inquiry} assigns cases. A Society Official, with an air of quiet authority, presents the latest mystery: a locked-room murder at the prestigious \textbf{Brass Orchid}. The club’s owner, \textbf{Madame Yvette Duval}, contacted the Society in desperation, realising that only the most capable investigators could unravel the enigma before her reputation—and her clientele—are irreparably damaged.

The Brass Orchid remains under lockdown, but such restrictions cannot last indefinitely. Its wealthy and influential patrons will not tolerate confinement for long unless the authorities become involved. The pressure mounts: the investigators must reach the crime scene swiftly before key witnesses scatter and vital evidence is lost to time and subterfuge.

\begin{WyrdGmTips}
	In episodic settings, the \textbf{Call to Adventure} often renders such introductory scenes optional. However, in the first few sessions, as players familiarise themselves with the world, engaging in a scene outside the primary investigation can add depth and immersion. Receiving a case assignment is a natural opportunity to establish tone, introduce key NPCs, and reinforce the Society’s role in orchestrating these investigations.
