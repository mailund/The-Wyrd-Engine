\WyrdCapLine{S}{kills} in \wyrd{} are intentionally broad, allowing them to cover a wide range of situations. This ensures that player characters can tackle most challenges using just a few well-chosen abilities.

You are encouraged to create your own skills and skill lists tailored to your setting. The skills presented in this chapter are not exhaustive or definitiveâ€”they are examples meant to serve as a foundation. Use them as inspiration or as a guide when designing your own.

To aid clarity, skills are grouped into broad categories. Some categories may overlap, and not all skills are suitable for every setting. Genre-specific skills are marked accordingly.

Skill breadth varies: some are quite general, while others are more focused. When creating a list for your setting, aim to maintain a consistent level of granularity. This chapter includes both broad and narrow skills to illustrate the range of possibilities.

A few \textbf{advanced skills} are also included, with references to their associated \textbf{base skills}. If you are not using skill progression, you may treat these as examples of narrower, more specialised abilities. In that case, you can ignore references to progression and how advanced skills interact with their base counterparts.
