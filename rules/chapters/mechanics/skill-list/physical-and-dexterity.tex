\section{Physical \& Dexterity}

This category represents raw physical ability and agile coordination—running, fighting, dodging, climbing, and moving with precision or force. These are the skills used to survive a chase, win a brawl, leap across rooftops, or avoid a deadly trap. Whether you're an acrobat, duellist, marksman, or street thief, this category covers how your character acts with speed, power, and grace.

Physical \& Dexterity skills are essential in high-action settings where danger is measured in moments and a missed step can mean death.
