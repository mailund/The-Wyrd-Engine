\section{Resilience \& Willpower}

This category represents your character’s ability to endure physical hardship, resist mental strain, and push through fear or exhaustion. It governs raw toughness, emotional control, and the ability to stay focused under pressure. Whether you're walking through fire, standing against psychic intrusion, or surviving the cold grip of despair, these skills measure your capacity to hold fast when others would fall.

Resilience \& Willpower skills are especially important in horror, survival, or high-stress adventures, where grit, composure, and inner strength are often more important than physical prowess.
