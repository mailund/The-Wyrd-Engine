\section{Basic Combat in The Wyrd Engine}
\index{Combat}

The role of combat varies by setting, scenario, and playstyle. Some games favour \textbf{quick, brutal encounters}, where a single shot or swift blade ends a fight instantly, while others emphasise \textbf{heroic battles} against overwhelming foes. The \textbf{tone and pacing} should reflect the game's themes—whether it’s gritty realism, where injuries are severe, or cinematic action, where characters endure incredible feats. Combat may be \textbf{tactically complex}, rewarding careful planning, or more \textbf{freeform}, focusing on dramatic exchanges over strict mechanics. \wyrd offers a flexible system to suit different narratives. For detailed combat mechanics and customisation, see \fullchapref{chap:combat}.

Basic combat in \wyrd, as described in this chapter, is designed to be \textbf{fast and cinematic}. Most combat encounters resolve within a few quick combat maneuvers and rounds of opposition rolls, keeping the action moving without bogging down in excessive mechanics. At the same time, characters are relatively hard to take out. In real life, a single blow, stab, or gunshot wound is enough to kill a person, but in the combat rules in this chapter, taking out a character will take a few rounds unless the opponent is super-human in capabilities.

The combat rules do not distinguish between physical and mental combat. If your setting involves psychic or magic attacks, the wounds characters can suffer might all be on the inside, but the game mechanics will be the same as physical combat.

\subsection{Initiative: Who Acts First?}
\index{Combat!Initiative} 

Combat follows a structured yet flexible turn order:

\begin{Example}{Determining Initiative}
	\begin{itemize}\raggedright
    	\item \textbf{Surprise \& Readiness:} If one side is clearly ambushing the other, they act first.
	    \item \textbf{Tactical Positioning:} If no clear ambush is present, the GM determines turn order based on readiness.
	    \item \textbf{Rolling for Initiative:} If multiple characters are competing to act first, roll \textbf{4dF + Notice} (or another relevant skill). The highest roll acts first, with ties resolved narratively.
	\end{itemize}
\end{Example}

\subsection{Taking Actions in Combat}
\index{Combat actions}

On their turn, a character can do the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{One primary action} (Attack, defend, use an item, create an advantage using an offensive or defensive manoeuvre)
    \item \textbf{One minor action} (Draw a weapon, reposition, open a door, shout a command)
    \item \textbf{Free actions} (Speaking briefly, minor environmental interactions)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Attacking and Defending}
\index{Combat!Attacking}\index{Combat!Defending}

Attacks are resolved using opposed rolls:
\begin{Example}{Attack Resolution}
	\begin{itemize}
    	\item The attacker rolls \textbf{\Attack = \FudgeRoll + skill + traits}
	    \item The defender rolls \textbf{\Defend = \FudgeRoll + skill + traits} 	    
	    \item If \textbf{Attack > Defend}, the attack lands and deals damage.
	\end{itemize}
\end{Example}

Relevant skills depend on the setting, but attack skills could be \textbf{Fight} for melee or \textbf{Shoot} for firearms, while defence skills could be \textbf{Athletics} for dodging or \textbf{Fight} for parrying. Traits are any relevant character or gear traits that match the combat situation.

If the defender has a higher score than or equal to the attacker, the attack is averted, and no damage is dealt. Ties are always in the defender's favour. If the attacker scores higher, the damage inflicted on the defender is the attacker's score minus the defender's.

\begin{Example}{Calculating Damage}
    \textbf{\Damage = \Attack - \Defend} when \textbf{\Attack > \Defend}.
\end{Example}

\Damage is determined by how much the \Attack exceeds \Defend. Effects such as weapons efficiency or armour thickness are considered through the gear's traits in the combat rolls. This has the same effect as adding weapon and defence bonuses within the existing conflict resolution system. We don't need extra combat rules if we don't want them.

\begin{Example}{Example Attack}
	Jonathan Blackwood swings a cane at an enemy thug. He rolls \textbf{4dF +2 (Fight)}, while the thug rolls \textbf{4dF +1 (Athletics)} to dodge. If Jonathan’s result is higher, the hit lands; otherwise, it is defended.
	
	Jonathan rolls \FudgeRes{+++-} = 2 and gets a score of \textbf{Attack = +4} when combined with his \textbf{Fight} skill. The thug then rolls \FudgeRes{+--0} = -1, giving him a score of \textbf{Defend = 0} when combined with his \textbf{Athletics}.
	
	Since Jonathan's score is higher, so he scores a hit, and the damage he inflicts is \textbf{\Damage = \Attack - \Defend = +4 - 0 = +4}. The thug takes \textbf{+4} in damage.
\end{Example}


\subsection{Stress: Fatigue and Wounds}
\index{Damage}\index{Stress}\index{Fatigue}\index{Wounds}
\index{Damage!Stress}\index{Damage!Wounds}
\index{Stress!Soaking up damage}

\wyrd uses the term \textbf{Stress} for all types of damage a character can sustain. This includes physical, mental, and social damage. Stress is a measure of how much damage a character can take before they are incapacitated. The term \textbf{Stress} is used to represent the overall damage a character can take, while \textbf{Fatigue} and \textbf{Wounds} are used to represent different types of damage.

\wyrd uses \textbf{Fatigue}\index{Damage!Fatigue}\index{Fatigue} to represent minor injuries and \textbf{Wounds}\index{Damage!Wounds}\index{Wounds} for more serious, lasting harm. Neither kind of stress is necessarily physical; mental damage is lumped in with physical stress in the core rules. In games where reputation or social standing is important, social damage can be represented as stress or wounds. The GM and players should agree on how to represent these types of damage in the game.

\begin{Example}{Fatigue and Wounds}
	\begin{itemize}\raggedright
    	\item \textbf{Fatigue:} Represents minor setbacks, fatigue, or temporary injuries. These are automatically cleared after a fight.
	    \item \textbf{Wounds} come in three levels of severity. They take longer to heal, and adds penalties for future actions.
	\end{itemize}
\end{Example}

Any damage inflicted must be soaked up by either \textbf{Fatigue} or \textbf{Wounds}. By default, each player has three \emph{Fatigue boxes}, \FatigueBoxes, and three \emph{Wounds boxes} where the wounds are split into three categories: one \textbf{Mild Wound} (\MildWounds), one \textbf{Moderate Wound} (\ModerateWounds), and one \textbf{Severe Wound} (\SevereWounds). NPCs can have different distributions of stress boxes and different settings can have different defaults for player characters. These boxes, combined, are where a character can soak up damage.

\DamageBox

When a character sustains \Damage, the damage dealt is converted one-to-one into these stress and wound boxes. Stress is soaked up by the boxes top-to-bottom; the fatigue boxes will soak up the first three points of stress. After that, the following stress point is inflicted as a mild wound, the next as a moderate wound, and finally, the character suffers a severe wound. If all stress boxes are ticked off, and the character takes further damage, the character is \textbf{out of action} (see \textsc{Death and the End of Combat} on page~\pagereftext{core:death}).

For characters with more than one of a given wound type, the wound boxes are ticked off the way fatigue boxes are, from left to right. If, for example, a monster has three \textbf{Fatigue}, three \textbf{Mild Wounds} and two \textbf{Moderate Wounds} and suffers 4 stresses, it would tick off all three fatigue boxes and one mild wound. If it then suffered 3 more stresses, it would tick off the remaining two mild wounds and one moderate wound.

  
\begin{Example}{Example: Fatigue Damage}
	As Captain Elias Mercer crouches in the engine room, setting the last charge to sabotage the enemy airship, he is caught off guard by a patrolling crew member. A swift jab to the ribs and a pistol whip to the shoulder deal \textbf{+2} damage. With no previous injuries, the damage is absorbed entirely by his fatigue boxes ticking off two of them
	
	\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
	\DamageBox[fatigue=2]

	\noindent
	Gritting his teeth, he shoves the attacker aside and makes his escape—knowing the real danger will come when the explosives detonate.
\end{Example}


When you tick off fatigue boxes, the damage has no noticeable effect. Fatigue is not considered lasting damage but the exhaustion accumulating from combat (or the ``flesh wounds'' from 90s action movies). Once the damage goes into wounds, however, future skill rolls are affected.

\begin{DndTable}[header=]{ll}
    \textbf{Wound Type} & \textbf{Effect} \\
    \textbf{Mild Wound}     & -1 to relevant skill rolls \\
    \textbf{Moderate Wound} & -2 to relevant skill rolls \\
    \textbf{Severe Wound}   & -3 to relevant skill rolls \\
\end{DndTable}

When taking a wound of any of the three kinds, the player and Game Master decide on which relevant skills or traits are affected by the wound. The \textbf{-2} and \textbf{-3} penalties for \textbf{Moderate} and \textbf{Severe} Wounds can be split among multiple skills as long as the total penalty remains the same. Any future rolls involving those skills or traits will have the penalty applied until the wound is healed (see \textsc{Healing and Recovery}~\pagereftext{core:healing}). 

For characters or creatures with multiple of the same type of wounds, additional wounds of the same kind do not add additional penalties when using the core rules.

\begin{Example}{Example: Wound Damage}
	While fleeing the engine room, Captain Mercer, the enemy he knocked aside, recovers, reaches for his gun, and fires off a shot (\FudgeRes{++-0} + \textbf{Shoot (+1)} for an \Attack of \textbf{+2}). Mercer attempts to duck (\FudgeRes{+--0} + \textbf{Atheletics (+1)} for a \Defend of \textbf{0}). The difference is a \Damage of \textbf{+2}.
	
	Mercer only has one fatigue box left, so one of the damage points goes into his \textbf{Mild} wound, and the player and GM decide that the bullet graces Captain Mercer's shoulder, which would affect the \textbf{Athletics} skill.
	
	\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
	\DamageBox[fatigue=3,mild=1,mildtext=\textbf{Athletics (-1)}]

	Taking the wound in his strides, he exits the room and continues his escape.
\end{Example}

When a character takes a wound with a penalty greater than one, the player and GM decide how to split the penalty between skills. The player can choose to apply the penalty to a single skill or split it between multiple skills. The total penalty must equal the wound's severity.

\begin{Example}{Example: Wound Damage}
	Captain Mercer rushes to the railing of the airship to throw himself off before the explosive device he planted detonates. The interruption in the engine room, unfortunately, has delayed him too long. The second he jumps, the bomb detonates. The shockwave hits his back with a \textbf{+1} of damage. His Fatigue and Mild Wound are already ticked off, so he has to take the damage to his \textbf{Moderate Wound}. The \textbf{Moderate Wound} give him a penalty of \textbf{-2}, which he and the GM decide to split between \textbf{Atheletics} and \textbf{Awareness} (reasoning that getting blown up is likely to affect Mercer both physically and mentally).
	
	\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
	\DamageBox[%
		fatigue=3,%
		mild=1,%
		mildtext=\textbf{Athletics (-1)},%
		moderate=1,%
		moderatetext=\textbf{Athletics (-1), Awareness (-1)}%
	]
	
	\noindent
	The two penalties to \textbf{Athletics} stack, so any roll involving \textbf{Athletics} will have a \textbf{-2} penalty.
\end{Example}

As long as a character has any damage is in a wound category, the penalty applies. Additional stress to a wound category that is already marked does not add additional penalties. Penalties from different categories can stack, however.

\begin{Example}{Example: Monster With Multiple Wounds}
	The players confront a swamp-dwelling horror known as the Hollow Maw. This creature has three \textbf{Fatigue} boxes, \textbf{two Mild Wounds}, \textbf{two Moderate Wounds}, and \textbf{one Severe Wound}. It starts the fight uninjured.

	\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
	\DamageBox[%
		totalfatigue=3,%
		totalmild=2,%
		totalmoderate=2,%
		totalsevere=1%
	]

	\noindent\textbf{Round 1:}  
	A quick spell from the party’s mage lashes the creature with burning light for \textbf{+3} damage. The Hollow Maw absorbs this with its three \textbf{Fatigue} boxes.

	\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
	\DamageBox[%
		totalfatigue=3,%
		totalmild=2,%
		totalmoderate=2,%
		totalsevere=1,%
		fatigue=3%
	]

	\noindent\textbf{Round 2:}  
	The fighter drives a spear into the beast’s flank, scoring a hit that deals \textbf{+1} damage. With its fatigue exhausted, the damage now overflows into wounds and we mark one \textbf{Mild Wound}. The GM decides the mild wound impairs its ability to lurch forward.

	\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
	\DamageBox[%
		totalfatigue=3,%
		totalmild=2,%
		totalmoderate=2,%
		totalsevere=1,%
		fatigue=3,%
		mild=1,%
		mildtext=\textbf{Movement (-1)}%
	]

	\noindent\textbf{Round 3:} 
	The barbarian charges in, swinging a massive axe for \textbf{+3} of damage. This ticks the second \textbf{Mild Wound} and both \textbf{Moderate Wounds}. The GM rules that the creature is now disoriented all its senses are impaired.

	\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
	\DamageBox[%
		totalfatigue=3,%
		totalmild=2,%
		totalmoderate=2,%
		totalsevere=1,%
		fatigue=3,%
		mild=2,%
		moderate=2,%
		mildtext=\textbf{Movement (-1)},%
		moderatetext=\textbf{Senses (-2)}%
	]

	Even though we have ticked two mild and two moderate wounds, we have only added one -1 penalty for both mild wounds and one -2 for both moderate wounds.

	\textbf{Round 4:}  
	A lucky shot from the gunslinger pierces part of the creature’s exposed back, causing \textbf{+3} damage. The Hollow Maw only has one (severe) wound left, which is not enough to soak up three damage, so it is now taken \textbf{out of action}.

	\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
	\DamageBox[%
		fatigue=3,%
		mild=2,%
		mildtext=\textbf{Movement (-1)},%
		moderate=2,%
		moderatetext=\textbf{Senses (-2)},%
		severe=1,%
		severetext=\textbf{All Actions (-3)}%
	]
\end{Example}

If all stress boxes are filled, and take further damage, the character is out of action. What this means is up to the GM, but games are usually more fun if player characters live to fight another day. For one-shot games, it is okay to kill off characters towards the end of the session, but don't do it early in the game.


\subsection{Combat Maneuvers}
Instead of simply attacking, players can use tactical manoeuvres. Simply slugging it out, with attacks and defence opposition rolls, makes for long and tedious combat. Two equally matched characters are expected to need more than ten rounds before on is taken out (see table \pagereftext{tbl:damage-probability}) and there is little excitement in that.

Instead, players can use their skills to create advantages for themselves or their allies, or to hinder their enemies. This is done by using a skill roll to create an advantage or disadvantage in the combat situation. Instead of attacking, a character can use the action to add a bonus to their next attack of defence roll, adding a \textbf{+2} to the next roll. This is done by rolling \textbf{4dF + skill} and comparing the result to the GM's target number (which as usual depends on what the character is trying to achieve). If the roll is successful, the character can add a \textbf{+2} bonus to their next attack or defence roll.

\begin{Example}{Combat Maneuvers}
	\begin{itemize}\raggedright
    	\item \textbf{Disarm:} Use Fight to knock a weapon from an opponent’s hands.
	    \item \textbf{Grapple:} Use Fight vs. Athletics to restrain an enemy.
    	\item \textbf{Push:} Use Athletics to shove an opponent into hazards.
	    \item \textbf{Feint:} Use Deceive to trick an enemy into missing a defence.
    	\item \textbf{Suppressing Fire:} Use Shoot to force enemies into cover.
	    \item \textbf{Intimidate:} Use Provoke to demoralize foes.
	\end{itemize}
\end{Example}

\wyrd does not have rules for all the myriad ways actions can be used in combat. However, the GM should generally convert an action into either an unopposed or opposed obstacle and let the outcome affect bonuses and penalties for future dice rolls. Using manoeuvres gives players a way to use skills besides the obvious combat skills (e.g. \textbf{Fight} or \textbf{Shoot}) as part of a combat encounter. A character with poor combat skills, with little chance of effectively dealing damage, might use other skills to stack up bonuses until an effective attack is possible.

If a manoeuvre attempt fails, all accumulated bonuses of that form, attack of defence, are lost. The risk of losing accumulated bonuses prevents combat from turning into one long string of manoeuvres.

Combat manoeuvres adds a little bit of tactical depth to combat, without making it too complicated. Players can use their skills to create advantages for themselves or their allies, or to hinder their enemies. There is strategy in deciding when to build bonuses and when to attack, and since bonuses are always used at the next attack or defence rolls, characters can team up to let a weak attack from one character defuse built up defense bonuses, making the defender vulnerable to the next attack that might have built up sufficient bonuses to be an effective kill.


\subsection{Healing and Recovery}\label{core:healing}
\index{Healing}\index{Recovery}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fatigue} clears at the end of a scene.
    \item \textbf{Mild Wounds} require a short rest (a few hours) or first aid.
    \item \textbf{Moderate Wounds} require days of rest or professional medical care.
    \item \textbf{Severe Wounds} require weeks of rest, surgery, or supernatural healing (if applicable).
\end{itemize}

When healing wounds, \emph{all} marked wound boxes are cleared at the same time. They are healed in parallel, so a character with both \textbf{Mild} and \textbf{Moderate} wounds will have the mild wounds healed the following day (regardless of how many wounds are ticked) and the moderate wounds after a week (with no delay because the mild wounds were healing at the same time).


\subsection{Weapons and Gear in Combat}
Weapons do not deal numeric damage but affect combat through \textbf{Traits}. Weapon traits work the same way as any gear trait and can be used when attacking or defending.

\begin{Example}{Examples of Weapon Traits}
	\begin{itemize}
    	\item \textbf{Weapons with Traits} grant \textbf{+2} in relevant situations (e.g., “Mastercrafted Rapier” gives +2 to Fight in duels).
	    \item \textbf{Firearms} can inflict instant Wounds if the shot is well-placed.
    	\item \textbf{Improvised Weapons} may impose a penalty unless the character is skilled in their use.
	\end{itemize}
\end{Example}

When a weapon's \textbf{Trait} adds to the attack of a character, it will indirectly affect the damage the attack is inflicting. More interesting uses of weapon traits give other advantages to their wielder.

\begin{Example}{Example Weapon Traits}
	\begin{itemize}
    	\item \textbf{Fine Dueling Sabre} – \textit{+2 to Fight when dueling.}
	    \item \textbf{Hidden Derringer} – \textit{Once per scene, draw a concealed firearm unnoticed.}
	\end{itemize}
\end{Example}

\subsection{Death and the End of Combat}\label{core:death}
When a character suffers a \textbf{Severe Wound} and takes further damage, they are at risk of death. The simplest choice here is to equate all damage boxes ticked off and character death, but this is not always the best option. It might be fine for nameless mooks the players are fighting but for player characters or important (or just interesting) NPCs, it is often more interesting to consider such a character \textbf{defeated} rather than \textbf{dead}.

Instead of killing off characters, take them captured. Beat them up and leave them for death. Anything \emph{interesting} that can still count as a defeat. Of course, depending on their situation and the setting you are playing in. A zombie is unlikely to capture a character, so true to the zombie genre, you might want to kill off characters there. A vampire, on the other hand, could start monologing about vampiric superiority for long enough that the character could be rescued. 

If you do consider the last wound as essentially death, you might still allow:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A final desperate action before succumbing.
    \item A chance to survive if an ally intervenes.
    \item A dramatic consequence, such as permanent injury.
\end{itemize}

\begin{GmTips}
	If a player is at risk of death, consider instead narrative consequences rather than instant removal. A major wound or permanent injury can be more interesting than a sudden death.
\end{GmTips}


\newcolumn
\subsection{Conceding the Fight}\index{Conceding}\label{core:conceding}

Taking damage until every \textbf{Stress} and \textbf{Wound} box is filled isn’t the only way to lose a fight. Aside from relentless automatons or mindless undead, few combatants fight to the bitter end if they can avoid it. Most will choose survival over certain death, whether that means surrendering, retreating, or negotiating terms. Even when capture is worse than death, most characters will attempt to escape rather than throw their lives away in a hopeless battle.

In \wyrd, conceding a fight is a structured choice, not a failure. When a character concedes, they avoid immediate defeat on their opponent’s terms but \textbf{must accept significant narrative consequences}. The victorious side determines the outcome, though the conceding player can influence how events unfold. A character might escape, but only after dropping their weapons and fleeing unarmed. They might surrender and be taken prisoner, leading to future complications. A successful concession may even allow a character to bargain their way out, leaving them battered but still in play.

By conceding, players trade mechanical defeat for \textbf{a more dramatic and survivable consequence}, shaping the story in ways a simple knockout never could. Game Masters should encourage this approach—fights that end in death leave no room for development, but those that end in setbacks, bargains, or rivalries fuel engaging future encounters.

Combat ends when one side is defeated, flees, or surrenders. Survivors must then deal with the consequences of their wounds, the choices they made, and the path ahead.

\begin{GmTips}
	Avoid fights to the death when possible—sometimes the real story begins when players choose to live. If they retreat, make escape costly: a vengeful pursuer, a lost artefact, or new complications.

	Letting enemies flee can be even more compelling. Survivors may warn allies, regroup, or return with reinforcements. 

	Death ends a fight; consequences deepen the story.
\end{GmTips}
