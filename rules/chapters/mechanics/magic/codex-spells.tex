\section{Codex Spells}

Depending on how you wish to use the \emph{Codex Infinitum} system, you will either consider spells as broad skills, purchased using the same budget, or you will have narrower scope spells you purchace from a separate spell buddget. This section gives you examples of spells for both choices.


\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Broad Spells} are purchased and ranked like ordinary Skills. Each spell represents a wide magical discipline—ideal for characters who want mastery in a specific field.
    \item \textbf{Narrow Spells} are purchased from a separate spell budget. Each spell is focused in effect, allowing for greater customisation and flexibility.
\end{itemize}

Do not mix Broad and Narrow systems in the same game unless carefully balanced. A character either builds their magic through a few versatile Broad Spells or through a larger collection of Narrow Spells with more specific functions. This is similar to how you would either use a few broad skills in a setting, or a wider range of narrow skills.

\subsection{Broad Spells}

Broad Spells are treated as Skills and must be purchased at a cost of \textbf{+1 to +4}, following the usual rules for the setting. Each spell is a comprehensive magical discipline, with scaling power based on rank.

\begin{WyrdSpell}[Elemental]{Flameworking}
    The art of conjuring, shaping, and commanding fire. Practitioners of Flameworking learn not only to unleash destructive forces, but to wield fire as a tool—bringing light to darkness, fear to enemies, or warmth to the dying.

    \begin{WyrdSpellBlock}
        \item[+1] Ignite dry material, brand surfaces with heat sigils, hurl a focused spark that can deal stress in close combat or light enemies aflame over time.
        \item[+2] Launch volatile firebolts at a distance; ignite unattended flammable objects; melt through rope, wood, or iron bars over time.
        \item[+3] Shape flames into defensive barriers or project burning lines; cause explosive reactions in nearby volatile materials.
        \item[+4] Call upon greater flame—summon elemental fire spirits, create infernos that spread across terrain, or rain fire from above in open skies.
    \end{WyrdSpellBlock}
\end{WyrdSpell}

\begin{WyrdSpell}[Abjuration]{Warding}
    Warding weaves arcane patterns into space, anchoring protective energies that repel harm, deflect curses, or resist intrusion. Masters of this art are defenders, sealers, and sanctifiers.

    \begin{WyrdSpellBlock}
        \item[+1] Create a simple ward circle that resists minor intrusion (physical or magical); ward a weapon against decay or a door against opening for a few moments.
        \item[+2] Project a barrier that blocks one attack or slows movement through a portal; suppress a weak enchantment or spirit within a small object.
        \item[+3] Ward an entire room or group against hostile effects; reflect the first harmful spell; create temporary sanctuaries.
        \item[+4] Bind curses into place or suppress greater entities; create large-scale defensive wards across terrain or buildings.
    \end{WyrdSpellBlock}
\end{WyrdSpell}

\begin{WyrdSpell}[Illusion]{Veilcraft}
    Masters of Veilcraft bend light, sound, and perception to create illusions, misdirect the senses, and veil their presence. This is the art of misdirection—powerful when subtle, overwhelming when bold.

    \begin{WyrdSpellBlock}
        \item[+1] Cloak yourself from sight briefly in dim conditions; distort your voice; mislead someone's perception of your direction.
        \item[+2] Create visual or auditory illusions large enough to distract or deceive multiple people; mask your identity completely at close range.
        \item[+3] Craft persistent illusions that react believably; duplicate another's appearance and mannerisms for hours at a time.
        \item[+4] Trap targets in fully immersive illusions affecting all senses; hide large objects, creatures, or locations from mundane and magical sight.
    \end{WyrdSpellBlock}
\end{WyrdSpell}

\begin{WyrdSpell}[Chronomancy]{Chronoshaping}
    Chronoshaping deals with the manipulation of time in bounded ways—altering the flow of moments to act faster, perceive deeper, or bend causality.

    \begin{WyrdSpellBlock}
        \item[+1] Act before others in initiative; slow a falling object; replay a sound or image from a moment ago.
        \item[+2] Delay a small object's motion (e.g., arrow mid-air); take an extra minor action in a round; accelerate personal movement.
        \item[+3] Freeze a target in place for a moment (opposed); reverse a short action you just took; glimpse the immediate future.
        \item[+4] Suspend time in a small area for a few seconds; act twice in a round without penalty; alter the outcome of a single recent roll.
    \end{WyrdSpellBlock}
\end{WyrdSpell}

\begin{WyrdSpell}[Divination]{Augury}
    The art of peering beyond the present: into distant places, concealed truths, and veiled intentions. Augury grants vision, insight, and omens—but at the risk of revealing things best left hidden.

    \begin{WyrdSpellBlock}
        \item[+1] Sense nearby magic, lies, or danger; learn a single fact about a person, object, or place through signs and symbols.
        \item[+2] Ask a yes/no question and receive a symbolic omen; scry a familiar person or place from afar; detect magical concealment.
        \item[+3] Read the surface thoughts of a target (opposed); know a hidden truth about someone’s past; receive a cryptic glimpse of the near future.
        \item[+4] Reveal the true nature of a being or artifact; uncover long-lost secrets or false memories; force a prophetic vision upon someone.
    \end{WyrdSpellBlock}
\end{WyrdSpell}

\begin{WyrdSpell}[Necromancy]{Necromancy}
    The forbidden art of binding, animating, and communing with the dead. Necromancers walk a line between power and damnation, using the essence of life—and death—as fuel for their will.

    \begin{WyrdSpellBlock}
        \item[+1] Sense death nearby; speak briefly with a fresh corpse; slow bleeding or accelerate decay.

        \item[+3] Raise multiple minor undead; siphon life to heal wounds; bind a soul fragment into an object.
        \item[+4] Command powerful undead or construct bone guardians; erase memory of the dead; curse a target with lingering rot.
        \item[+5] Bind the spirit of a recently deceased target, question them, or trap them; raise a small army of loyal undead until sunrise.
    \end{WyrdSpellBlock}
\end{WyrdSpell}

\begin{WyrdSpell}[Elemental]{Stormbinding}
    Stormbinding is the mastery of sky, wind, thunder, and the raw fury of weather. Its wielders are rare and terrifying, calling upon powers that cannot be contained—only channeled.

    \begin{WyrdSpellBlock}
        \item[+1] Call a strong gust to knock over objects or disorient; produce static to jolt a creature or ignite flammables.
        \item[+2] Redirect arrows, bolts, or debris with gale winds; summon rolling thunder to startle or deafen.
        \item[+3] Launch a directed bolt of lightning (single target); create a wind barrier that grants +2 defence or impedes movement.

        \item[+6] Become the storm—channel elemental power through your body, unleash a sky-splitting lightning strike, or scatter armies with a cyclone.
    \end{WyrdSpellBlock}
\end{WyrdSpell}

\begin{WyrdSpell}[Conjuration]{Translocation}
    Translocation is the study of space and its folding. It allows the caster to traverse great distances, alter proximity, or bypass obstacles. A dangerous art when used recklessly.

    \begin{WyrdSpellBlock}
        \item[+1] Instantly reach an object within arm’s length; shift a hand through a locked container; step across a small gap.
        \item[+2] Swap places with a visible ally; blink a few meters behind cover; place a rune to return to later in the scene.
        \item[+3] Teleport yourself (or a willing creature) across a room or past a barrier; bend space to appear behind an enemy.
        \item[+4] Fold space across long distances; instantly relocate across a known area; walk through walls as a shimmering blur.
    \end{WyrdSpellBlock}
\end{WyrdSpell}

\begin{WyrdSpell}[Runes]{Runecraft}
    The ancient and meticulous art of embedding magic into symbols, glyphs, and inscriptions. Unlike other magic, Runecraft is deliberate, stable, and durable—but slow to prepare.

    \begin{WyrdSpellBlock}
        \item[+1] Etch a glyph into an object to make it glow, hum, or resist weathering; scribe a rune that triggers a soft sound when approached.
        \item[+2] Inscribe a delayed spell (e.g. fire bolt, alarm, fear); anchor a ward to a surface; mark a binding circle for a known creature.
        \item[+3] Create a complex multi-glyph array to store energy, trigger effects under conditions, or permanently enchant a tool with minor effects.
    \end{WyrdSpellBlock}
\end{WyrdSpell}

\subsection{Narrow Spells}

Narrow Spells are smaller in scope and purchased from a separate spell budget determined by the GM. For example, players may have 4–6 points to spend on spells at character creation, rather than investing from their core Skill points.

\begin{WyrdSpell}[Elemental]{Fireball}
    A tightly focused evocation that conjures a blazing orb and hurls it toward a target. Though simple in concept, the spell scales in force and devastation, becoming a hallmark of battlefield casters who favour destructive precision.

    \begin{WyrdSpellBlock}
        \item[+1] Hurl a fireball that explodes on impact, affecting a single target within medium range. Causes moderate stress and may ignite flammable targets or surroundings.
        \item[+2] Expand the fireball’s blast radius to strike up to 3 adjacent targets or objects. Range increases to long. You may shape the fire to avoid allies.
        \item[+3] Unleash a high-impact fireball with a 10-foot blast radius. Deals high stress to all in the zone, shatters weak structures, and leaves the area ablaze. The impact is loud and unmistakable.
    \end{WyrdSpellBlock}
\end{WyrdSpell}

\begin{WyrdSpell}[Illusion]{Mirror Image}
    A classic illusion spell that creates illusory duplicates of the caster, confusing enemies and making it difficult to discern the real target. The duplicates are not solid and cannot attack.

    \begin{WyrdSpellBlock}
        \item[+1] Create 1 illusory duplicate of yourself that mimics your movements. The duplicate lasts for a few minutes or until dispelled.
        \item[+2] Create 2 duplicates that move independently, making it harder to identify the real you. The duplicates last for a scene or until dispelled.
        \item[+3] Create 3 duplicates that can act independently, moving and mimicking your actions. The duplicates last for an hour or until dispelled.
    \end{WyrdSpellBlock}
\end{WyrdSpell}


\begin{WyrdSpell}[Abjuration]{Ward of Binding}
    A structured warding spell that anchors arcane sigils to a physical location, sealing portals or anchoring a force in place. This spell is favoured by wardens, inquisitors, and artificers who deal with spirits, summoned creatures, or fleeing foes.

    \begin{WyrdSpellBlock}
        \item[+1] Seal a door, window, or container with arcane force for a few minutes. Breaking the seal requires overcoming a +2 obstacle with \textbf{Physique} or \textbf{Will}.
        \item[+2] Strengthen the binding to last an hour or suppress a creature’s ability to cross a threshold. Breaking it now requires +4 effort or a specific ritual to dispel.
        \item[+3] Create a complex ward that binds a summoned entity in place or seals a location indefinitely until the glyph is destroyed. You may include a condition for release (e.g. a spoken phrase, a drop of blood).
    \end{WyrdSpellBlock}
\end{WyrdSpell}

\begin{WyrdSpell}[Chronomancy]{Time Slip}
    A tactical manipulation of personal timeflow, allowing a caster to move faster or act outside the normal rhythm of the world. Favoured by duelists, spies, and agents of arcane espionage.

    \begin{WyrdSpellBlock}
        \item[+1] Blur forward in time just enough to act before others. Gain +2 to Initiative or take a free minor action at the start of your turn.
        \item[+2] Accelerate your movements to take two full actions this round (instead of one major and one minor). Cannot be repeated on the next round.
        \item[+3] Step outside the flow of time for a heartbeat, acting freely while others remain frozen. You may ignore all actions or attacks made this round, but must re-enter time next turn.
    \end{WyrdSpellBlock}
\end{WyrdSpell}

\begin{WyrdSpell}[Translocation]{Echo Step}
    A rapid displacement technique that allows the caster to move through space with momentary afterimages or blurred motion. Less flashy than full teleportation, but prized by infiltrators and duelists.

    \begin{WyrdSpellBlock}
        \item[+1] Instantly blink a few meters in any direction, bypassing terrain or cover. Gain +2 to defence against ranged attacks until your next turn.
        \item[+2] Teleport to any point within your line of sight (up to a room’s length). You leave behind a shimmering echo that distracts enemies for one round.
        \item[+3] Chain multiple rapid blinks in a single turn, allowing you to cross large terrain or phase through narrow walls. Enemies struggle to track your position, imposing a +2 penalty to their next attack against you.
    \end{WyrdSpellBlock}
\end{WyrdSpell}

\begin{WyrdSpell}[Illusion]{Phantom Sound}
    Conjures sounds where none exist. Used to mislead, distract, or mimic—perfect for spies, tricksters, and scouts.

    \begin{WyrdSpellBlock}
        \item[+1] Create a brief sound anywhere within shouting distance: footsteps, whispers, knocks, etc.
        \item[+2] Sustain a repeating or evolving sound (e.g., a crowd, crying baby, marching). Can move with your line of sight.
        \item[+3] Mimic a specific person’s voice or create layered sounds; fool magical detection unless opposed.
    \end{WyrdSpellBlock}
\end{WyrdSpell}

\begin{WyrdSpell}[Blood]{Sanguine Bond}
    A dangerous rite that links your vitality to another. Used to share strength—or suffering.

    \begin{WyrdSpellBlock}
        \item[+1] Create a sympathetic link with a touched target. You may transfer up to 1 Fatigue between you.
        \item[+2] Redirect minor wounds from one party to another. You may absorb 1 Wound dealt to someone you’re bonded to.
        \item[+3] Enforce the bond on an unwilling subject (opposed by \textbf{Will}). For 1 scene, any damage they take may be split with you—or transferred entirely.
    \end{WyrdSpellBlock}
\end{WyrdSpell}

\begin{WyrdSpell}[Divination]{Omen of Falling Leaves}
    A ritual that reads the pattern of falling or scattered leaves to reveal cryptic truths. Best used in quiet moments or as foreshadowing.

        \item[+2] Receive a vision or flash of someone’s future actions within the next hour.

    \end{WyrdSpellBlock}
\end{WyrdSpell}

        \item[+1] Cause the ground to grab an enemy’s foot, imposing a +2 penalty to their next movement or action.
        \item[+2] Trap one or both legs in stone. Target must beat a +2 obstacle with \textbf{Physique} to escape.
        \item[+3] Fully restrain a target in a cocoon of earth. Holds even supernatural creatures, if not dispelled.
    \end{WyrdSpellBlock}
\end{WyrdSpell}

\begin{WyrdSpell}[Elemental]{Frozen Vein}
    Channel moisture into a freezing strike. This spell disrupts, chills, and disables rather than destroys.

    \begin{WyrdSpellBlock}
        \item[+1] Coat a weapon in ice for 1 scene. Attacks deal +1 damage and slow movement on a hit.
        \item[+2] Hurl a freezing wave or cone. Enemies caught must pass \textbf{Physique} or take Fatigue and lose their next move.
        \item[+3] Freeze a 10-foot area solid—immobilising terrain, extinguishing fires, and sealing objects shut.
    \end{WyrdSpellBlock}
\end{WyrdSpell}

\begin{WyrdSpell}[Necromancy]{Bone Shard}
    A piercing necrotic projectile formed from bone — your own or scavenged. Whispers follow in its wake.

    \begin{WyrdSpellBlock}
        \item[+1] Launch a jagged bone spike at a target. Deals +2 damage and causes lingering spiritual unease.
        \item[+2] Bone anchors in flesh, dealing +2 damage and imposing a -2 penalty to the target’s next roll.
        \item[+3] Bone shatters violently after impact, damaging adjacent targets and temporarily weakening magical defences.
    \end{WyrdSpellBlock}
\end{WyrdSpell}

\begin{WyrdSpell}[Conjuration]{Summon Familiar}

        \item[+2] The familiar can scout ahead, relay messages, and perform minor tasks (e.g., fetch items).

    \end{WyrdSpellBlock}
\end{WyrdSpell}

\begin{WyrdSpell}[Conjuration]{Summon Elemental}

        \item[+2] The elemental can fight alongside you, using its own actions to distract or attack.

\end{WyrdSpell}

        \item[+2] Become nearly invisible in darkness; you leave no sound or scent while cloaked.
