\section{The Gift of Twilight}

\begin{Example}{}
    The Gift belongs to old places—forgotten villages, mist-shrouded woods, windswept moors, and crossroads that never appear on maps. It lingers in lullabies and carved stones, in stories passed down by those who no longer remember why. Magic in these lands is not studied or controlled; it is felt, inherited, and feared. The boundary between the mundane and the mythic is thin, and those who bear the Gift often do so at a cost—marked by dreams, strange silences, or eyes that see too much. In such settings, the world itself seems to remember things long past, and sometimes it remembers you back.
\end{Example}

\textit{The Gift of Twilight} is a \emph{soft magic} system—high in narrative freedom, low in mechanical constraint. It’s not about control or precision, but about mystery, symbolism, and emotional resonance. Magic in this system emerges through intuition and memory, where the line between the real and the unreal is blurred. Effects are not measured in damage or distance, but in meaning.

The system relies on evocative \textbf{Traits} that grant narrative permission to perform strange or wondrous acts—such as speaking to stones, sensing lost things, or recalling forgotten names. When the outcome is uncertain, the GM may call for a skill roll—typically \textbf{Lore}, \textbf{Presence}, or \textbf{Will}. Success stirs old powers. Failure may draw their attention.

\begin{GmTips}
    The Gift of Twilight is a \emph{soft magic} system, high in narrative freedom and low in mechanical constraint. Ideal for folk horror, fairy tales, mythic modern settings, or low-magic campaigns where mystery is key. It is not well suited for players who enjoy tactical gameplay or precise mechanics, as it relies heavily on narrative interpretation and the GM's discretion.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Pros:} Flexible, narrative-driven, encourages creativity and storytelling.
        \item \textbf{Cons:} Less predictable, may frustrate players who prefer clear mechanics or tactical options.
        \item \textbf{Best For:} Settings with a focus on folklore, mystery, and emotional resonance. Ideal for one-shots or campaigns where magic is rare and wondrous.
        \item \textbf{Not For:} Players who prefer hard mechanics, tactical gameplay, or a focus on combat and strategy.
    \end{itemize}
\end{GmTips}

\subsection{Using the Gift: The Mechanics}

The Gift isn’t cast—it’s invoked. It happens when the moment is right, when something remembered or promised is brought forward into the present. Magic often takes the form of subtle interventions, coincidences, or quiet revelations.

Player characters with the Gift should have one or more Traits reflecting their connection to the otherworldly, such as:  
\begin{Example}{Example Gifts}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Touched by the Old Road}  
        \item \textit{Knows the Names of Trees}  
        \item \textit{The Last of the Dreaming Blood}  
    \end{itemize}
\end{Example}

These Traits don’t provide fixed bonuses. Instead, they grant narrative access to supernatural effects. When a player wish to use the Gift, they describe what they want to do and how it connects to their Trait. The GM may ask for a roll if the outcome is uncertain, but the focus remains on the story rather than strict mechanics.

\begin{Example}{Invoking the Gift}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}l p{0.8\linewidth}@{}}
        \textbf{Player:} & “I want to call on the old road to find a way through the fog.”  \\
        \textbf{GM:} & “That’s a good use of your Trait. Describe how you do it.” \\
        \textbf{Player:} & “I close my eyes and listen to the whispers in the mist. I remember the stories of those who walked before me.”  \\
        \textbf{GM:} & “Roll Lore to see if you can hear them.”
    \end{tabular}    
\end{Example}

In the sense of mechanics, \emph{The Gift of Twilight} is as simple as it gets. We have added a special type of Trait called \textbf{Gift} and everything else is handled by improvisation. The Gift is not a skill, nor a power, nor a spell. It is a narrative permission to do something that is not possible otherwise.

For a player group that likes improvisation and storytelling, this is a great way to add magic to the game. But it does rely heavily on improvisation, and for new and less experienced players, it may be a bit overwhelming.

\subsection{Guidelines for GMs}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Let players describe what their magic looks and feels like. Trust the tone of the moment.
    \item The Gift rarely solves problems directly—it changes the context, shifts fate, or reveals hidden truths.
    \item Magic should always have a cost, but not necessarily one tracked in stress. A memory, a favour, or an unwanted connection may be more appropriate.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Optional Consequences}

For tables that want a bit more mechanical tension, consider adding one of the following consequences:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Wyrd Tides:} After invoking the Gift, roll a die. On a \FudgeDie{-}, something unintended stirs.
    \item \textbf{The Debt:} Each use of the Gift creates a narrative debt to a power or presence. It will call on the character—sooner or later.
    \item \textbf{The Mark:} Frequent use leaves visible or spiritual traces—glowing eyes, silence that follows them, or unsettling dreams. These may attract attention from beings better left undisturbed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{In Summary}

\textit{The Gift of Twilight} is for stories where magic is strange, subtle, and laced with consequence. It invites wonder, not certainty. Players who enjoy mystery, folklore, and the poetry of power will feel right at home.
