\section{Adapting Skills}\label{toolbox:sec:adapting-skills}

\index{Skills}

Skills are the backbone of most mechanical interactions in \wyrd, and adapting them is one of the most direct ways to tailor the system to your setting. The core rules offer a streamlined and versatile skill list, but you are encouraged to reshape it to fit the needs of your world. Whether you're adjusting for a specific genre, introducing new types of conflict, or simply looking to give characters more specialised roles, modifying the skill system allows you to bring tone and theme to the forefront. In the sections that follow, we explore the different ways you can adapt the skill list—by changing its level of detail, adjusting how skills function, and incorporating setting-specific elements.

\subsection{Levels of Detail}\label{toolbox:detailed-skill-lists}
\index{Skills!Granularity}
\index{Skills!Complexity}

The more detailed your skill list, the more mechanical variety your characters can express—but this comes at the cost of speed and simplicity. A short, broad skill list is ideal for games that emphasise narrative flow and improvisation. A longer, more detailed list works better for tactical play, complex investigations, or games where niche expertise matters.

The level of detail you choose will influence character identity, spotlight moments, and the kinds of stories your game is best equipped to tell. A one-shot game about magical investigators might keep things simple with a single \textit{Magic} skill, while a long-running campaign about academic wizards could break that down into \textit{Rituals}, \textit{Alchemy}, \textit{Runes}, and \textit{Summoning}.

\begin{CommentBox}{Quick Tip: Choose Your Skill Scope}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use \textbf{broad skills} like \textit{Combat}, \textit{Technology}, or \textit{Magic} for high-level, fast-paced games.
        \item Use \textbf{narrow skills} like \textit{Blades}, \textit{Firearms}, or \textit{Arcane Lore} for games focused on detail, strategy, or realism.
        \item Blend both by starting with broad skills and expanding only the ones that matter to your setting or your players.
    \end{itemize}
\end{CommentBox}

\subsubsection{Example: Broad vs. Specific Skills}
\index{Skills!Example}

The detail levels of skills can greatly affect how characters differentiate themselves. In a game with a broad skill list, characters may feel similar even if they have different backgrounds or personalities. This can lead to a lack of distinctiveness in character roles and abilities.

Consider two characters in a swashbuckling adventure game: \textbf{Captain Elise Vaunt} is a charismatic privateer and master duelist. \textbf{Professor Thaddeus Wren} is a scholarly gentleman with a dark past in the royal navy.

If your game uses a broad skill list, both characters might look quite similar:

\begin{SkillsBox}
    \Expert  & Combat \\
    \Skilled & Persuade \\
    \Novice  & Lore
\end{SkillsBox}

You would probably \emph{play} the characters differently, but the \emph{mechanics} would be almost identical. In any situation where one of the characters is likely to succeed of fail, the other is as well. They might have different backgrounds and personalities, but their skills are so broad that they can both do everything equally well. This can lead to a lack of distinctiveness in character roles and abilities.

But with a more granular skill list, their differences become much clearer:

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
\noindent
\textbf{Captain Elise Vaunt:}
\begin{SkillsBox}
    \Expert  & Swords \\
    \Skilled & Intimidate \\
    \Novice  & Navigation
\end{SkillsBox}

\noindent
\textbf{Professor Thaddeus Wren:}
\begin{SkillsBox}
    \Expert  & Pistols \\
    \Skilled & Etiquette \\
    \Novice  & History
\end{SkillsBox}

Now, their roles in the story and in gameplay feel much more distinct. Elise dominates in close combat and commands the deck with fearsome presence. Thaddeus excels in duels at a distance and navigates social intrigue with ease. The characters feel more unique because the skills are more focused—and that clarity can help both players and GMs build scenes where each can shine.


\subsubsection{Adjusting the Skill Budget for Detail}
\index{Skills!Budget}
\index{Skills!Detailed Skill Lists}

When you increase the granularity of your skill list, you should consider expanding the \textbf{skill budget}—that is, the number of skill ranks available to characters during creation. The more specific your skills become, the more ranks characters need to remain competent across the same range of activities.

For example, if a broad skill like \textit{Combat} is split into \textit{Swords}, \textit{Pistols}, and \textit{Unarmed}, a character who would have taken \textit{Combat} at +3 might now need to spread their ranks across multiple areas to reflect the same breadth of capability. Without increasing the number of skill picks available, characters become artificially limited—not because of concept or balance, but because of mechanical compression.

The goal of increasing detail isn’t to make characters weaker, but to make their abilities more specific. To maintain the same level of competence, you’ll want to give players more points to distribute when using a longer or more detailed skill list. This ensures characters feel just as capable, while allowing their specialities and limitations to emerge more clearly in play.

As a rough guideline, you might increase the total number of ranks allowed by +2 to +4 when moving from a broad list of around 10 skills to a more detailed list of 15 to 20. You may also want to slightly raise the cap for individual skills (e.g., from +3 to +4) if you want players to be able to achieve strong specialisation without sacrificing versatility.


\subsubsection{Default Skill Levels}
\index{Skills!Default Levels}
\index{Skills!Untrained}

In the standard \wyrd rules, characters are assumed to have a \textbf{default skill level of 0} in any skill they do not explicitly take. This makes sense when using a broad skill list—most characters can attempt common actions like running, persuading, or shooting without specialised training. A +0 represents baseline competence, where a character relies on raw talent or experience rather than honed expertise.

However, as your skill list becomes more detailed, this assumption may no longer hold. In a setting with specific and technical skills, certain tasks may reasonably require training just to attempt. For instance, it might be fair to assume that most characters can drive a ground vehicle (\textit{Driving} at +0), but not everyone knows how to perform mid-flight repairs on a damaged starship (\textit{Hyperdrive Repair} might default to \textbf{–4}, or even be unavailable without a relevant Trait).

You can adjust default values on a skill-by-skill basis. Ask yourself: could an untrained person even attempt this? If so, what’s their chance of success? If not, consider requiring a Trait, narrative justification, or a different approach entirely. You might also group certain advanced skills under prerequisites or special permissions to make their rarity explicit.

\begin{CommentBox}{Guiding Defaults}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{+0:} Common knowledge or intuitive actions (\textit{Climb}, \textit{Charm}, \textit{First Aid}).
        \item \textbf{–2:} Specialist tasks with some public awareness (\textit{Surgery}, \textit{Codebreaking}, \textit{Forgery}).
        \item \textbf{–4:} Highly technical or dangerous skills unlikely to be attempted without training (\textit{Hyperdrive Repair}, \textit{Necromancy}, \textit{Nuclear Engineering}).
        \item \textbf{N/A:} Cannot be attempted at all without a specific Trait or background.
    \end{itemize}
\end{CommentBox}

Customising default skill levels adds flavour and helps enforce genre expectations. In a gritty cyberpunk world, even a street-savvy hacker might have no idea how to pilot a corporate dropship. In a mythic fantasy setting, few outside the high temples would dare attempt divine rituals. Use defaults not to punish players, but to shape the world and encourage meaningful choices in character creation.

\section{FIXME BELOW}

%% FIXME: TO HERE

Some settings benefit from \textbf{tiered} skill structures—where one broad skill (like \textit{Combat}) unlocks or governs several sub-skills (like \textit{Melee}, \textit{Ranged}, \textit{Unarmed}). You can treat the parent skill as a prerequisite, or as a cap for how high the sub-skills can be rated.

Tiered systems are more complex to track but allow for fine-tuned character customisation. Consider them if your setting revolves around mastery, schooling, or complex specialisation—such as martial arts temples, military training, or academic disciplines.

\subsection{Custom Skill Effects}\label{toolbox:custom-skill-effects}
\index{Skills!Custom Effects}

Although most skills work the same way—rolling to overcome an obstacle or create an advantage—you can add unique effects or permissions for specific skills. For instance, a \textit{Fear} skill might be usable as an attack in horror-themed games. A \textit{Magic} skill might allow creating temporary advantages with elemental force. A \textit{Politics} skill might interact with faction reputation.

These additions can make your skill list feel more alive and setting-specific, especially when certain skills enable special actions others cannot perform.

\begin{CommentBox}{Skill-Based Worldbuilding}
    If only characters with the \textit{Occult} skill can perceive spirits, that says something about your world.  
    If everyone has \textit{Hacking}, it says something else. Use your skill list to show what’s normal—and what’s extraordinary.
\end{CommentBox}

\subsection{Cultural and Setting-Specific Skills}
Some games thrive when skill lists reflect cultural knowledge, world assumptions, or unique technologies. For example, a post-apocalyptic setting might replace \textit{Technology} with \textit{Scavenging} or \textit{Repurposing}. A faerie-tale world might include \textit{Glamour}, \textit{Wyrd}, or \textit{Bargaining} as standalone skills.

These decisions bring flavour and cohesion to your skill list, but be mindful of how often a given skill will be useful. A skill that only applies once or twice in a campaign may be better represented as a Trait instead.

\subsection{Hybrid and Conditional Skills}
Sometimes a skill might straddle two roles. A skill like \textit{Survival} might be used for physical endurance, wilderness navigation, and resisting fear in certain settings. You can define conditional uses for skills that serve multiple narrative purposes—just be clear with your players about what each skill covers.

You can also let certain Traits expand how a skill functions. For instance, a Trait like \textit{Soldier’s Discipline} might let a player use \textit{Will} to resist physical intimidation or pain, blurring the line between mental and physical endurance.

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
That concludes our look at adapting the skill system. The core idea is this: use your skill list as a lever to shape tone, pace, and complexity. Add detail where it matters to your setting; strip it back where speed and clarity are more important. The more intentional your choices, the more your skill list will reinforce your game’s identity.


\subsection{Skill progression}\label{toolbox:skill-progress}
\index{Skill progress}
\index{Skills!Progression}
\index{Skills!Prerequisites}

%% FIXME: lead up to this paragraph...
You can use them to create a sense of progression, or to add prerequisites for certain skills. For example, you might require that a character has the \textit{Unarmed Combat} skill before they can learn \textit{Martial Arts}. This can help to create a sense of realism and immersion in your game world.
