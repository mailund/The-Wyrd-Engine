\subsection{{\small Keeper of Forgotten Debts}\\ Rahjin the Ledger-Eater}
\label{npc:rahjin-ledger-eater}

\emph{He speaks softly, but always with numbers. The desert knows its debts—and Rahjin never forgets.}
\vspace{.5\baselineskip}

\columnratio{0.375,0.375,0.25}
\begin{paracol}{3}
    \subsubsection*{Background:}
    Rahjin was once a humble scribe for the Treasury of Sand, but after surviving a purge by naming every official’s secret debt aloud, he became a broker of favours, blood, and ruin. Now known as the Ledger-Eater, he walks between courts and crypts, whispering of balances unpaid. He carries no weapons—but his name alone can collapse reputations.

    He offers information, clean slates, or ruin to those who deal wisely. But every favour owed is etched into his silent ledgers, written in dust or tattooed onto skin.

    \switchcolumn
    \subsubsection*{Using in Play:}
    Rahjin is a neutral—but dangerous—power broker. Use him to:
    \begin{itemize}\raggedright
        \item Offer rare information in exchange for future debts.
        \item Threaten players with unknown obligations tied to their pasts.
        \item Manipulate nobles, guilds, or even crime syndicates through economic whispers.
        \item Deliver cryptic warnings that turn out to be stunningly accurate.
    \end{itemize}

    He’s ideal for scenes involving deals, manipulation, or uncertain loyalties.

\subsection{{\small Ashcraft Sorceress of the Dunes}\\ Iszara of the Ember-Sigh}
\label{npc:iszara-ember-sigh}

\emph{Her eyes smoulder with stories. Her fire does not burn—it remembers.}
\vspace{.5\baselineskip}

\columnratio{0.375,0.375,0.25}
\begin{paracol}{3}
    \subsubsection*{Background:}
    Iszara was orphaned during the Fall of Ireveth, when the city’s fires never went out. She walked out of those flames untouched, speaking a name no one taught her. Now, she serves no master but flame itself.

    A rare practitioner of Ashcraft, Iszara blends memory, fire, and grief into her spells. She believes flame is a storyteller—and her role is to speak its truth through ash and ember. She has little interest in politics, but follows signs, dreams, and burning omens with alarming precision.

    \switchcolumn
    \subsubsection*{Using in Play:}
    Iszara is a mystic guide, dangerous hermit, or flame-wielding ally. She may:
    \begin{itemize}\raggedright
        \item Appear suddenly when fire is invoked or a sacred place burns.
        \item Offer cryptic insights or dream-prophecies.
        \item Aid the players with magic—but always demand they "repay" the flame.
        \item Serve as a quest-giver tied to ancient firebound secrets.
    \end{itemize}

    She is powerful, but rarely stays in one place long.

        \noindent\textbf{+2 Listen to the Fire} \\
        \noindent\textbf{+2 Walk Through Flame} \\
        \noindent\textbf{+2 Survive in the Desert Heat}
    \subsubsection{Traits}
        \textbf{Touched by Flame} — Once per scene, ignore the Magic Point cost of a +1 spell.\\
        \textbf{Ashbound Omen} — Can declare a symbolic dream or sign that predicts an event, triggering GM intervention or insight.
