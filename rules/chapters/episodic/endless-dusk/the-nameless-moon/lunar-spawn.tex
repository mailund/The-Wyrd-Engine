  \emph{It once resembled a jackal—until the moon carved new limbs from its shadow.}
  
  \subsubsection*{Background:}
  Lunar Spawn are the first signs of the Nameless Moon’s influence. Once mundane scavengers or alley beasts, their forms have warped under the silverlight—elongated jaws, pale hide, limbs that phase in and out of physical space. They hunt in pairs or packs, drawn to sound, magic, and blood.
  
  When one dies, it bursts into a brief howl that echoes across rooftops—possibly summoning more.
