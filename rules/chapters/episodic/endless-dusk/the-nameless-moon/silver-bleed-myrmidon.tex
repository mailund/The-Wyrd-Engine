  \emph{Steel-plated limbs. No eyes. It doesn’t need to see—only to end the noise.}
  
  \subsubsection*{Background:}
  These hulking mutants are former city guards or mercenaries caught beneath the Nameless Moon and reshaped into brutal enforcers. Their skin is scarred with silver veins. Their breath rattles like crushed bone. No speech—just a low growl and the sound of armour slamming stone.
  
  Some say they still remember names—but only long enough to carve them into walls.
