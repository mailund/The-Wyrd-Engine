  \emph{"The true moon has no name because it was never meant to be spoken."}
  
  \subsubsection*{Background:}
  A devoted servant of the Lunar Remnant, this acolyte channels unstable celestial energy through arcane chants, sacrificial ink, and reflective glyphs carved into flesh. Their eyes shine with a silver gleam. Their voice echoes with two tones—one human, one distant.
  
  They are not meant for prolonged fights—but the magic they wield can shatter focus, warp gravity, or burn memory.
