\begin{description}\raggedright
    \item[Kaelen Vire (page \pageref{pc:kaelen-vire})] --- A grim sellsword bearing a cursed blade and a deeper wound. Once a champion, now a haunted weapon-for-hire, Kaelen cuts through monsters and memory alike.

    \item[Idrani of the Ember Road (page \pageref{pc:idrani-ember})] --- A desert-born Ashcraft sorceress who weaves grief into flame. Idrani’s fire is both weapon and wound, burning brighter with every name she cannot forget.

    \item[Thariq the Viper-Handed (page \pageref{pc:thariq-viper})] --- A smiling thief raised in market alleys and snake pits. Thariq steals secrets, poisons rivals, and slips through shadows with venomous grace.

    \item[Father Mourn (page \pageref{pc:father-mourn})] --- An exiled priest of the Hollow Star, wandering the dunes with heretical prayers and a voice that twists the will of gods and mortals alike.

    \item[Vexa Flintspike (page \pageref{pc:vexa-flintspike})] --- A scarred mercenary who breaks relics for coin. Vexa solves magical problems with blunt force and alchemical charges—usually in that order.

    {Kaelen Vire}
    {“I am the blade that never sleeps.”}
    \label{pc:kaelen-vire}

    Once a famed arena duelist, Kaelen Vire now wanders the edge of civilisation as a cursed sellsword. His blade—\textit{Whisperfang}—was earned in ritual combat, but its voice has never left him. Each foe he cuts, each night he survives, adds another whisper to the chorus. He doesn't seek glory. He seeks silence.

    \subsection{Background}
    Trained by the Bladed Crescent, Kaelen won his freedom by killing his master in sanctioned combat—then fled when the sword refused to let him rest. Now he fights for coin, travelling from city to ruin, answering to steel and nightmare alike.

    \subsection{Appearance}
    Broad-shouldered and quiet-eyed, Kaelen wears sand-scorched lamellar armour and a tattered dueling cloak. Whisperfang, curved and dark-bladed, hangs at his side. Its scabbard is wrapped in prayer cloth—and stained through.

    \subsection{Personality}
    Stoic, brutal, and unnervingly calm. Kaelen speaks little unless asked, but watches everything. He doesn’t relish violence—but he’s very, very good at it.

    \subsection{Connection to the World}
    Known in taverns and forts across the south. Feared by cultists, respected by caravan guards. Once hired by the Sapphire Concord, but left after a relic “spoke back.”

    \subsection{Goals}
    End the curse that binds his sword—and perhaps himself—to a cycle of violence.

\begin{WyrdCharacterSheet}
    {Idrani of the Ember Road}
    {“Grief is the kindling. I am the flame.”}
    \label{pc:idrani-ember}

    Idrani was born beneath the scalding skies of the southern caravan trails, raised by a dying cult of fire-keepers who taught her to sing the names of the dead into flame. When their shrine was destroyed, she walked alone—her grief becoming a weapon, her magic a mirror of all she lost. 

    She does not weep anymore. She burns.

    \subsection{Background}
    Idrani was once one of the Ember Acolytes, a dwindling sect that believed memory could be transmuted through fire. Her magic is Ashcraft—old, ritualistic, and tied to loss. The more she gives up, the stronger her flame becomes.

    \subsection{Appearance}
    Idrani wears cracked red silk robes over fire-scorched armour, her skin dusted with fine ash. Her left arm is tattooed with the names of her fallen kin—each one burned in by hand.

    \subsection{Personality}
    Controlled. Measured. Burning from within. Idrani is slow to trust but quick to act when lives are at risk. Her sorrow makes her strong, not soft.

    \subsection{Connection to the World}
    Wanderers, mourners, and broken cults know her name. She carries fire through forgotten places and offers light—if not always warmth.

    \subsection{Goals}
    To find the source of the dream-fire that speaks her name—and decide whether to embrace or destroy it.

        \item[Flamebrand Knife] — +2 to Ember Grasp or Ignite Object if the blade is drawn across skin or cloth.

        \item[Ash Pouch] — +2 to Occultism when consulting ashes, burnt bones, or fire remains.
