    \emph{This hulking construct was designed to break siege breaches. It now treats all intruders as enemy combatants. Its arms end in crushing wheels. Its chest sigils spark erratically.}
  
    The sentinel animates when more than one player stands on the platform. It attempts to push targets into the adjacent gear shafts or crush them against the wall.
