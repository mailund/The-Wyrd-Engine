    \emph{A final defense construct directly linked to the control core. Its movements are methodical, its limbs reinforced with rune-cabling, and its arcane shielding draws from the core’s unstable power.}
  
    The Guardian activates when the players interfere with the control pillar or anchor ring. It focuses on protecting the core, not chasing intruders. It deflects attacks with shifting magical plates drawn from the ring’s circuitry.
