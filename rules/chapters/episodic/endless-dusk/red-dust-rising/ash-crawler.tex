    \emph{An old debris-clearing construct repurposed by time and damage into a hostile, autonomous threat. Its rune-core sputters. Its blades remain sharp enough to matter.}
  
    The Ash-Crawler bursts from a low hatch shortly after the players navigate the initial breach. It targets the first character to move or speak loudly, attempting to drive them back toward the exit.
