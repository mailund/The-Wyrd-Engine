\begin{NPC}[description=Inventor with a taste for espionage]{Evelyn Baker}
  
    \emph{An ambitious mind hidden behind a pair of soot-smudged goggles, Evelyn Baker has made a name for herself in the back alleys of invention—where patents are stolen, not filed.}
    \vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
  
    \subsubsection*{Background:}
    Once an idealistic prodigy from the Royal Aetheric Institute, Evelyn Baker was blacklisted after accusations of prototype theft and unauthorised experimentation. Undeterred, she turned to the lucrative underworld of industrial espionage, selling stolen schematics to the highest bidder and sabotaging rivals when contracts demanded it.
  
    She is brilliant, bitter, and unrepentant. Bellamy was a target—either for his research or for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Whether Evelyn orchestrated the murder herself or merely played a part in the sabotage depends on how far the investigators dig.

\begin{NPC}[description=An aristocratic industrialist]{Lord Ashford Greymark}

    \raggedright
    \emph{A calculating nobleman who cloaks ruthless ambition in the language of duty and national interest. To Lord Greymark, progress is war by other means.}
    \vspace{0.5\baselineskip}

    \subsubsection*{Background:}
    Once a reform-minded noble in Parliament, Greymark now represents the dark side of empire—leveraging science for control, and control for profit. His contract with the Ministry of Defence promised autonomous policing units within five years. That deadline is now looming.

    Greymark sees Thorne not as a rival but as a necessary sacrifice. Evelyn Baker was hired to acquire schematics discreetly—but when Bellamy threatened to interfere, Greymark had him eliminated to keep the project on schedule. His influence ensures any investigation into his affairs is stonewalled unless the evidence is undeniable.
