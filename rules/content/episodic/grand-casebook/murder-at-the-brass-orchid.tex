\section{Murder at the Brass Orchid}



The investigators are called to The Brass Orchid either by an inside contact, a desperate plea from the club’s owner, or at the behest of an anonymous benefactor. The establishment is filled with wealthy patrons, performers, and staff—each with their own secrets to hide. The club’s reputation is at stake, and the clock is ticking before the police arrive to sweep things under the rug.

The players must piece together the events of the evening, questioning patrons and staff, analysing the crime scene, and determining who had the means, motive, and opportunity to commit the crime. However, the deeper they dig, the more they realise that this murder is just the tip of the iceberg.

\subsection{Premise} 
A high-society soirée at the exclusive cabaret, The Brass Orchid, is cut short when a well-connected financier is found dead in a locked room. The party was attended by the city's elite, but none saw the murder happen—or so they claim. The investigators must navigate a world of secrets, deception, and hidden rivalries to uncover the truth.

\subsection{What Really Happened} 
Beatrice Langley, a hostess at The Brass Orchid, killed the financier, Edward Mercer, to protect herself from blackmail. Mercer had uncovered details about Beatrice’s past life and was threatening to expose her unless she paid a steep price. Desperate and out of options, she poisoned his drink and used the club’s pneumatic tube system to dispose of the evidence. However, a miscalculation led to certain clues being left behind.

\subsection{Act 1: The Crime Scene} 
The investigators arrive at The Brass Orchid and are quickly introduced to the case. The scene is a private lounge where Mercer’s body remains untouched. Clues present in the scene include:
\begin{DndReadAloud}{}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A half-finished drink laced with poison.
		\item The victim’s missing pocket watch. (Is later found in an unexpected location).
		\item The pneumatic tube system that leads in and out of various club areas.
	\end{itemize}
\end{DndReadAloud}

\begin{DndComment}{What the clues reveal}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The drink with poison reveals the cause of death.
		\item The missing pocket watch is currently in the hands of \textbf{Henry ``Rigs'' Rigby}, the bartender at the Orchid's lounge. He found it in the servers' area, where Beatrice dropped it after leaving the pneumatic tube system. The watch itself is not a clue, but the location where it was found is.
		\item The pneumatic tube system was used by Beatrice to leave the locked room. It leads to the servers' area and would normally not be noticed by patrons, hinting at a culprit amongst the staff.
	\end{itemize}
\end{DndComment}


Patrons and staff provide conflicting accounts, making it difficult to discern the truth at first. To spice things up, the GM can add further complications:
\begin{DndReadAloud}{\textbf{Complications:}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Club owner \textbf{Madame Yvette Duval} insists that the investigation remain discreet—if the scandal spreads, the club’s reputation is finished. 
		\item Meanwhile, \textbf{Inspector Julian Hargrave}, a police detective with little patience for private investigators, arrives and attempts to assert authority over the case.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\noindent
	The players must balance diplomacy, deception, or outright defiance to continue their work.
\end{DndReadAloud}



\subsection{Act 2: The Investigation} 

Players must navigate the web of lies surrounding the Brass Orchid’s elite clientele and staff. Key locations include:
\begin{DndReadAloud}{}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{The performers’ dressing rooms}, where whispers of illicit affairs and secret dealings emerge.
		\item \textbf{The club’s bar}, where a bartender, \textbf{Henry ``Rigs'' Rigby}, may know more than he lets on.
		\item \textbf{The back office}, where financial records hint at Mercer’s recent blackmail attempts.
	\end{itemize}
\end{DndReadAloud}

\noindent
A chase scene or social confrontation may occur if a suspect attempts to flee or cover up crucial evidence. The club’s owner, Madame Yvette Duval, will insist on discretion, urging players to avoid drawing attention.

\subsection{Act 3: The Reveal} 
With all the pieces in place, the investigators must confront \textbf{Beatrice Langley}. She will initially deny involvement but cracks under pressure if presented with compelling evidence:
\begin{DndReadAloud}{}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Traces of the poison} found in her personal belongings.
		\item \textbf{Testimonies from staff} who overheard threats.
		\item \textbf{Inconsistencies in her alibi}.
	\end{itemize}
\end{DndReadAloud}

\noindent
If handled carefully, she may confess outright. However, if the players push too hard or fail to secure proof, she may attempt to escape into the night, leading to a dramatic confrontation.

\subsection{Resolutions} 
Depending on how the investigators handle the case, different outcomes may occur:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Justice Served}: Beatrice is arrested or confesses, ensuring the truth is revealed.
	\item \textbf{A Deal in the Shadows}: The investigators allow Beatrice to flee, leveraging her knowledge for future gain.
	\item \textbf{The Wrong Culprit}: A scapegoat is framed, or the authorities arrest someone else entirely.
	\item \textbf{A Mystery Unsolved}: The players fail to piece everything together, leaving The Brass Orchid haunted by unanswered questions.
\end{itemize}

Regardless of the resolution, this case's events ripple across London’s elite, setting the stage for future intrigues.
