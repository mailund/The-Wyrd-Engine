\DndDropCapLine{T}{he} Wyrd Engine is a narrative-driven tabletop roleplaying game system designed to strike a balance between structured mechanics and freeform storytelling. Drawing inspiration from Fate and elements of GURPS, it aims to provide a streamlined, flexible framework that emphasises character-driven play while maintaining enough structure to support tactical decision-making.

\section{Philosophy and Design Goals}
The Wyrd Engine is built upon the following key design principles:

\subsection{Narrative-Driven Mechanics}
While many systems provide detailed simulationist mechanics, The Wyrd Engine prioritises narrative flow. Rules are designed to reinforce storytelling rather than constrain it, ensuring that mechanics facilitate player agency and character development rather than slow down the action.

\subsection{Modular and Setting-Agnostic}
The Wyrd Engine is intended to be adaptable to multiple settings, from Victorian steampunk mysteries to cosmic horror and high fantasy. Core mechanics remain consistent, while setting-specific options allow groups to tailor the experience to their preferred genre.

\subsection{Accessibility and Ease of Play}
Complexity often serves as a barrier to entry for new players. The Wyrd Engine simplifies character creation and conflict resolution, making it easy to learn while maintaining enough depth to satisfy experienced players. By replacing Fate Points with a more intuitive system and streamlining aspects and stunts, The Wyrd Engine reduces cognitive load without sacrificing strategic depth.

%\subsection{Balanced Character Progression}
%Characters in The Wyrd Engine develop through a flexible advancement system that ensures steady growth while maintaining balance. Skill caps and structured trait progression prevent power creep, allowing for a long-term campaign structure where characters evolve meaningfully without becoming overpowered.

\subsection{Collaborative Storytelling}
Roleplaying is a shared experience, and The Wyrd Engine encourages player collaboration. Mechanics are designed to give all players opportunities to contribute meaningfully to the story, ensuring that every character has a role to play in the unfolding narrative.

\section{What The Wyrd Engine Is Not}
While the system borrows elements from both narrative and tactical games, it is not intended to be a rigid simulation of reality. It does not use attributes, equipment-heavy mechanics, or detailed statistical modelling. Instead, it focuses on storytelling flexibility while maintaining just enough mechanical structure to create meaningful choices in gameplay.

By keeping these goals in mind, The Wyrd Engine offers a roleplaying experience that is both structured and freeing, supporting deep character development and immersive storytelling without unnecessary mechanical complexity.
