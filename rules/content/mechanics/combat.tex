\DndDropCapLine{T}{he} core combat system, as described in the previous chapter, will suffice for any setting where combat is not a large part of the play. There is next to no combat in Agatha Christie's novels, so we don't need detailed combat mechanics in a setting modelled around such types of crime mysteries. They would only get in the way. However, in other settings, Conan the Barbarian-like sword and sorcery or cyberpunk mercenary games, you likely want a few more details in the combat system---and in such settings, where you see combat often enough, learning more complex rules is also less of an issue.
