\chapter*{What Lingers}
\begin{WyrdSettingHeading}
    \WyrdCapLine{T}{here} are places the world forgets. Not through time or chance, but through silence—heavy, deliberate silence that settles like dust over memory, over names, over grief.

    \noindent
    Saint Hieronymus Monastery was once such a place. Tucked in the hills beyond the reach of rail or road, it served as a haven for those seeking peace, penance, or oblivion. Decades ago, it fell silent. No letters, no pilgrims, no word. The world moved on, and most forgot.

    But you did not forget. You couldn’t. Because someone you once loved—someone you still remember—was there when the silence began. And now, an envelope has arrived. No return address. Just your name, written in a familiar hand that time should have erased.

    Inside: a yellowed prayer card bearing the name \emph{Abbot Rian}, a brief message: \textit{"Come. Something remains. It must not."}

    The road to Saint Hieronymus is overgrown. The monastery stands still beneath a grey sky. No birds sing. The gates are open.

    Some silences are chosen. Others are imposed. This one—whatever it is—has waited for you.

    What lingers in the silence... and what will it take to bring it to light?
\end{WyrdSettingHeading}

\emph{What Lingers} is a mystery of atmosphere and memory, intended to unfold slowly and build toward a climactic confrontation. Players arrive at the abandoned Saint Hieronymus Monastery, drawn by personal ties to those who vanished decades ago. The silence they encounter is not merely the absence of sound—it is a force, pervasive and oppressive, one that resists being broken. The scenario is divided into three acts: investigation of the still grounds, descent into memory-haunted crypts, and a final confrontation with the spiritual entity known as the Eyeless Abbot. Each act tests different facets of play—emotional resilience, problem-solving, and tactical cooperation—culminating in a single boss battle where success hinges on recovering what was lost: identity, remembrance, and the power to speak one’s truth aloud.

\subsection*{The Premise}
\textbf{Decades ago}, Abbot Rian led the monks of Saint Hieronymus in a dangerous spiritual experiment. Obsessed with the idea of achieving divine purity through silence, he performed a ritual intended to sever worldly identity and bring the brothers into perfect spiritual stillness.

At the centre of the rite was the \emph{Campana Silens}, a funerary bell traditionally used to preserve memory and guide souls to rest. Rian reversed its purpose—twisting the sacred toll into a metaphysical anchor that would bind the monks to silence, preventing both speech and spiritual passage. The rite succeeded—terribly. The monks were erased. Only their robes remained.

Rian himself became the Eyeless Abbot, a spectral presence held together by silence and grief. He is no longer truly human. The monastery has remained untouched ever since, locked in a state of unnatural quiet. The letter that summoned the players may have been sent by a fading fragment of one of the monks—or by the Bell itself. The silence is fraying. Something within still remembers.

\emph{To lay the Abbot to rest, the players must find and ring the Campana Silens—risking collapse, confrontation, and the return of names long buried.}

\subsection*{The Letter}

Each player begins the scenario having received a letter—plain, yellowed, and sealed with cracked red wax. There is no return address. Only their name is written on the front, in handwriting they each recognise intimately: a parent, a sibling, a grandparent, a lost lover. Someone who disappeared without a trace, many years ago.

Inside the envelope is a prayer card from Saint Hieronymus Monastery, bearing the name \emph{Abbot Rian} and a half-faded devotional inscription. Alongside it, a simple note:

\begin{WyrdExample}
    \begin{quote}
        \textit{Come to the monastery. Something remains. It must not.}
    \end{quote}
\end{WyrdExample}
\begin{WyrdSidebar}[float=!b]{Who Sent the Letters?}
    The letters that summoned the players to Saint Hieronymus Monastery have no clear origin—and that is intentional. The handwriting belongs to loved ones long lost, yet the paper is pristine, the ink fresh. No mundane explanation fits.
    
    The truth is this: the letters were sent by a lingering spiritual fragment—a faint echo of one of the monks who resisted the rite. His name is lost, his voice long silenced, but some ember of will remained. Drawn to the players by threads of memory and grief, this presence reached across the veil through the only tool it had left: the Bell.
    
    The \emph{Campana Silens} remembers. Though corrupted, it still resonates with the identities it once preserved. Through it, the spirit crafted the letters—not as messages, but as echoes of personal connection, imitating the handwriting of the loved ones each character lost. The Bell called out, and those who still remembered… heard.
    
    \emph{GMs may choose to reveal this secret during the climax or leave it unsaid. The ambiguity strengthens the tone—some truths are better left incomplete.}
\end{WyrdSidebar}
    
The letter offers no explanation, yet the handwriting is unmistakable—and impossibly preserved. Whether out of longing, guilt, curiosity, or fear, the characters set out for the hills where Saint Hieronymus stands in ruin. No carriage goes that way. The path is overgrown. The air feels thinner the closer they get.

The monastery gates stand open, and the world behind them falls silent.

\emph{Each player should be encouraged to define the lost person in their life—someone whose name may have been buried, but never forgotten. This personal connection adds emotional weight to the events of the scenario, and may be invoked in key moments of memory or spiritual struggle.}

\section*{Act I – Echoes Before the Silence}

Before the players ever see the monastery, they are drawn together by a shared summons—and a shared loss. This act gives them time to establish emotional context, form initial connections, and feel the first stirrings of unease.

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}

\subsection*{Setting: The Last Waystation}

The journey begins in a rural village or isolated coaching inn—the last inhabited stop before the road to Saint Hieronymus vanishes into overgrowth. The air is misted, the weather grey. The locals speak little of the monastery. Some seem to have forgotten it entirely; others grow tense or evasive at its mention.

The characters are all passing through, each with a letter in hand. One by one, they recognise that they are not alone in their summons. Whether through comparing handwriting, shared names, or lingering grief, they begin to uncover what links them: someone they lost went to the monastery, and never came back.

\subsubsection{Mechanical Focus} This act is roleplay-heavy with light skill usage—Insight, Empathy, Lore. There are no direct Fatigue or Wounds yet, but GMs are encouraged to introduce subtle unease: a flickering candle, a remembered voice, a shadow that wasn’t there before.


\subsubsection{Scenes and Options}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Arrival and Suspicion:} Each character enters the village or inn separately. The innkeeper or a wary local may react oddly to their presence—or to the names on their letters.
    
    \item \textbf{Recognition and Revelation:} A player notices the handwriting on another’s letter. A shared glance, a mirrored grief, a moment of unspoken understanding brings them together.
    
    \item \textbf{A Shared Past (Optional):} The characters may discover that their relatives once knew each other—or vanished at the same time. A dusty record book or forgotten luggage may hint at others who made the same journey, and never returned.
    
    \item \textbf{A Warning:} A local elder, priest, or traveller offers a cryptic warning: \emph{“That place has been quiet too long. Whatever’s there... remembers.”}
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{Ending the Act} The act concludes when the players agree to travel the overgrown path together. The wind quiets. The trees thicken. And through the mist ahead, the dark silhouette of Saint Hieronymus Monastery begins to rise.


\section*{Act II – A Silence That Should Have Passed}

The players arrive at Saint Hieronymus Monastery. Nestled in the hills, it stands untouched by time—weathered but unbroken, its stone walls still sturdy, its gate unlatched. The air is unnaturally still. There are no birds, no insects, no wind. The silence is too perfect.

From the moment they step within the gate, sound begins to behave strangely. Footsteps are muffled. Whispers vanish. Even breath feels swallowed. The monastery is not just quiet—it is \emph{hungry} for silence.


\subsection{Exploration and Atmosphere}

The players may explore key locations within the monastery grounds:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Courtyard:} Overgrown but undisturbed. Prayer stones lie scattered around an empty well. Names have been scratched off the wall of remembrance.
    \item \textbf{The Chapel:} Candles still sit in their holders. Dust lies thick—yet there are no signs of decay. Pages of scripture are blank or overwritten with symbols the players can’t decipher.
    \item \textbf{The Dormitories:} Robes still hang neatly. Beds are made. Yet some of them are still warm.
    \item \textbf{The Refectory:} Tables are set as if awaiting a final meal. Bowls of ash sit where food might once have been.
\end{itemize}

The deeper the players go, the more they feel the monastery pushing back. Whispers intrude into their thoughts. Forgotten memories resurface. Names begin to slip from their tongues.

\subsection{Haunting Incidents}

Introduce one or two surreal or unnerving moments as tension builds:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A player finds a note in their own handwriting, written years ago, tucked inside a hymn book.
    \item A bell tolls once in the distance, though no bell is visible or accessible.
    \item A mirror reflects not their face—but someone they lost.
    \item A player attempts to speak and finds that no one hears them for a full minute.
\end{itemize}

These effects do not cause Wounds but may impose \emph{Fatigue} as the monastery erodes the players' sense of self. Players who resist through \textbf{Discipline}, \textbf{Focus}, or \textbf{Insight} may recover composure—but only briefly.

\subsection{Tone and Progression}

This act is about disorientation, emotional strain, and the weight of unresolved presence. There are no direct threats yet—only the creeping dread of a place that has not let go.

As the act concludes, the players find hints of something sealed below: a passage to the crypts, old inscriptions warning of silence made manifest, and the first references to the \emph{Campana Silens}. Someone—or something—did not wish it to be found again.

\section*{Act III – What the Stone Remembers}

The monastery has not given up all its secrets. Beneath the chapel or behind a sealed stairwell, the players uncover the entrance to the crypts—a place that feels colder, older, and heavier than the rest. The silence here is absolute. Even thought seems muted.

In these dark spaces, the boundaries between memory and reality unravel.

\subsection{Echoes and Illusions}

The crypts are home to echoes of those who were lost: faded fragments of monks who still linger in sorrow, guilt, or confusion. These are not ghosts in the traditional sense, but memory-constructs—emotional impressions impressed upon stone and silence.

Players may witness or interact with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A monk who endlessly copies names into a ledger—names the players recognise as their own.
    \item A vision of the final rite, led by Abbot Rian, in which the monks are stripped of their voices and vanish.
    \item A soundless plea scratched into the walls: \emph{“Ring the bell. Let us be.”}
    \item Personal visions—scenes from each player’s past, slightly altered, where their lost loved one begs them to forget.
\end{itemize}

These encounters are emotionally exhausting. Players resisting emotional collapse must use \textbf{Empathy}, \textbf{Discipline}, or \textbf{Will}. Some may begin taking \emph{Fatigue}—especially if they linger or interact too deeply.

\subsection{Discovery of the Bell}

Sealed behind a crumbling prayer wall lies a reliquary chamber containing the \emph{Campana Silens}—a funerary bell mounted on an ancient iron frame. Its inscription is worn, but a partial phrase remains:

\begin{quote}
\textit{“To ring is to remember. To remember is to suffer.”}
\end{quote}

The bell radiates a strange, pressing warmth—like grief made tangible. As the players approach, they feel watched. Something is aware of them now.

\emph{Ringing the bell will awaken the Eyeless Abbot, ending the silence—but also drawing his full attention.}

\begin{WyrdSidebar}{Campana Silens}

    \textbf{Campana Silens}, the Silent Bell, is a sacred funerary relic once used to preserve the names of the dead. Forged in iron and consecrated in ancient rites, it was designed to protect memory during the final passage—ensuring the deceased would not be forgotten.
    
    But Abbot Rian twisted its purpose. Instead of preserving memory, he used it to seal it away. The bell became an anchor for silence, stillness, and spiritual imprisonment. Now, it is the only thing capable of disrupting the unnatural peace he created.
    
    \textbf{Ringing the Bell} awakens the Eyeless Abbot and shatters the enforced silence. It is both a key and a weapon—but using it comes at a cost.
    
    \vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
    \textbf{Campana Silens — Item Trait:} \emph{Disrupts Spiritual Binding}
    
    \vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
    \textbf{Mechanics:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Action:} A player may ring the Bell as an action. Doing so causes an immediate shift in the environment (dust, sound, collapsing illusions).
        \item \textbf{Effect:} The Eyeless Abbot becomes vulnerable to \emph{Wounds} for the remainder of the scene.
        \item \textbf{Cost:} Each round after the Bell is rung, all characters gain 1 \emph{Fatigue} as the veil weakens and the burden of memory floods back.
        \item \textbf{Limit:} The Bell may only be rung once per scene.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \emph{Optional:} A player may ring the Bell using a memory of their lost loved one—turning the act into a moment of emotional defiance. If they do, they may refresh one Trait or remove 1 Fatigue as part of the action.
    
\end{WyrdSidebar}

    
\section*{Act IV – The Thing That Waits}

The final confrontation takes place in the monastery’s meditation hall—a vast, domed space of worn stone and flickering memory. When the players arrive, the Eyeless Abbot is already there. He appears as a figure in faded robes, face featureless, presence overwhelming. He does not speak. He does not need to.

The silence is nearly total. Players must strain even to think.

\subsection{The Eyeless Abbot}

Without the ringing of the \emph{Campana Silens}, the Abbot is untouchable. He phases through attacks, unravels identities, and suppresses voices and traits. His aura imposes a penalty on most checks and inflicts \emph{Fatigue} every round as the silence presses inward.

Once the Bell is rung, a shockwave passes through the monastery. The Abbot stumbles. The silence cracks. For the first time, he can be harmed.

\begin{WyrdFullNPC}[%

    description=Silence Incarnate,%

  ]{The Eyeless Abbot}
  
  \emph{Once Abbot Rian, a devout spiritual leader who sought to transcend worldly identity through perfect silence. He succeeded far too well. What remains is not a man, but a vessel of stillness—an unspoken wound in the fabric of memory.}
  
  \subsubsection*{Background:}
  The Eyeless Abbot lingers at the heart of Saint Hieronymus Monastery, an immovable anchor of grief and spiritual ruin. During a failed rite meant to dissolve the self, he bound his own soul—and those of his brethren—into a silence so deep it became a presence. He does not see, does not speak, and cannot be harmed by mortal means. Only the toll of the \emph{Campana Silens} can pull him into reach of the living.
  
  He does not attack with blade or fire. Instead, he erases. Names, memories, connections—all fade in his wake. To fight him is to fight forgetting itself.

\end{WyrdFullNPC}

\subsection{Fighting the Abbot}

\begin{WyrdComment}{Combat Notes}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The Abbot inflicts \emph{Fatigue} and \emph{Wounds} with spiritual pressure and memory attacks.
        \item He may target a player’s sense of identity, suppressing one of their Traits temporarily.
        \item The longer the fight continues, the more unstable the monastery becomes. Consider adding crumbling terrain, flickering visions, or summoned echoes.
    \end{itemize}
\end{WyrdComment}

Players may try to invoke the memory of their lost loved one to resist or reverse the Abbot’s erasure. These moments should be emotionally charged, and may grant a +2 bonus on key rolls or allow a Trait to refresh mid-combat.

\subsection{Victory and Aftermath}

If the Abbot is defeated, the silence lifts. Names return. The monastery shifts—either collapsing or fading fully into ruin. The players may hear one final toll of the bell as the spirits finally pass on.

If the players fail, they are absorbed into the stillness. Their identities fade. They remain in the monastery, their names forgotten, their stories unwritten.

\emph{Some silences can only be broken by remembering what was lost.}

\begin{WyrdCharacterSheet}
    {Dr. Clara Ashcroft} 
    {“Some stories are not told. They are buried. And they bleed through the silence.”}
  
    A cultural anthropologist specialising in ritual practice and memory, Clara Ashcroft is quiet, meticulous, and emotionally withdrawn. Her life's work revolves around forgotten spiritual sites and fringe religious communities, but her most personal mystery lies within Saint Hieronymus. Years ago, her younger sister, Evelyn, joined the monastery’s contemplative program—and was never heard from again.
  
    \subsection{Background}
    Clara was a senior lecturer at a university in Edinburgh, well-regarded for her research into memory, ritual, and folk beliefs. When Evelyn disappeared, Clara left academia behind and began investigating isolated monasteries, vanished communes, and other places where silence clings. Her work has become solitary and obsessive—an academic pursuit turned personal.
  
    \subsection{Appearance}
    Clara wears a long, functional raincoat with a laptop bag or field satchel always over her shoulder. Her hair is loosely tied, and she favours muted colours. Her eyes are sharp, but tired. She's often mistaken for a journalist or archaeologist—but speaks like someone who’s seen too much.
  
    \subsection{Personality}
    Clara is thoughtful, distant, and deeply rational—but beneath her composed surface is a raw grief she’s never allowed herself to feel. She treats emotion like data, but the closer she comes to the truth, the harder that becomes. She avoids connection but is fiercely protective once it's made.
  
    \subsection{Connection to the Monastery}
    Evelyn Ashcroft disappeared at Saint Hieronymus while participating in a modern-day spiritual retreat. Clara always suspected something was wrong—but had no proof, no access. Now, the letter has given her the first lead in nearly twenty years.
  
    \subsection{Goals}
    Clara seeks to uncover what happened to her sister, and by doing so, expose the truth about the monastery’s silence. She also hopes, secretly, to find some version of forgiveness—for Evelyn, and for herself.

    {Isaac Bellamy} 
    {“The war ended, but not for me. Some fights just change their shape.”}
  
    A former infantryman turned private security contractor, Isaac Bellamy is a man carved out of trauma and silence. After years spent in conflict zones, he returned to find his younger brother—his only family—had gone to Saint Hieronymus on a spiritual retreat. That was the last he ever heard from him.
  
    \subsection{Background}
    Isaac joined the military straight out of school and served multiple tours before transitioning into high-risk private security work. He’s seen what silence can mean in a firefight, and what it can hide in grief. His brother Elijah sought peace at the monastery after a breakdown—Isaac always feared it was a cult in disguise. When the place went quiet, Isaac went searching... but never found anything. Until now.
  
    \subsection{Appearance}
    Isaac wears a weathered field jacket, dark jeans, and durable hiking boots. His close-cropped hair and guarded stance mark him as someone used to danger. A locket with Elijah’s photo hangs around his neck, worn from years of handling.
  
    \subsection{Personality}
    Isaac is blunt, steady, and doesn’t waste words. He’s not easily rattled—but his silence isn’t peace, it’s armor. Loyalty means everything to him, and guilt weighs heavy on his shoulders. He’s used to being the one who makes the hard choices when no one else will.
  
    \subsection{Connection to the Monastery}
    Elijah Bellamy disappeared after joining a silent spiritual retreat hosted by Saint Hieronymus. Isaac never trusted it. When the monastery ceased all communication, he came looking. Now, years later, the letter has cracked the silence wide open.
  
    \subsection{Goals}
    Isaac wants the truth about what happened to his brother. He’s not afraid of ghosts, only of failing someone he loved—again. If he has to fight the dark to get answers, so be it.

    {Margot Delaney} 
    {“Faith asks us to believe. But no one tells you what to do when belief breaks.”}
  
    Margot Delaney is a former nurse and lifelong believer who once placed her hope in Saint Hieronymus Monastery. Years ago, her teenage daughter Eleanor was sent there to recover from a breakdown. When the monastery fell silent, so did the answers. Margot was told to let go. She never did.
  
    \subsection{Background}
    Margot worked in palliative care for over twenty years, walking others through the long process of grief. She once found strength in faith, but the unanswered questions around her daughter’s disappearance cracked something inside her. She left the church, left her job, and began quietly investigating on her own—looking for signs, for records, for anything the silence couldn’t bury.
  
    \subsection{Appearance}
    Margot wears a wool coat, boots, and practical layers—dressed for wind and wet ground. Her hair is pulled back neatly, with strands of grey at the temples. She carries a single worn photograph in her coat pocket, and her expression often lingers between sorrow and resolve.
  
    \subsection{Personality}
    Calm, warm, and unshakably determined. Margot is the kind of person others lean on—until they realise she’s carrying more weight than she shows. She speaks softly, but never vaguely. When she commits to something, she sees it through.
  
    \subsection{Connection to the Monastery}
    Margot sent her daughter Eleanor to Saint Hieronymus for spiritual healing after a mental health crisis. She visited twice. On the third attempt, she was told the monastery had closed its gates. No further contact was ever made.
  
    \subsection{Goals}
    Margot wants the truth—not just for Eleanor, but for herself. She seeks closure, but also understanding. She hopes to find proof that her daughter mattered—that her story didn’t simply vanish.

    {Micah Rios} 
    {“It’s not the dead that scare me. It’s what they remember—and what they want us to forget.”}
  
    Micah Rios has always been able to feel the echo of things left unfinished. Whether it's ghosts, trauma, or silence itself, something in him is tuned to it. He never sought this gift—but when the letter arrived, written in the hand of an uncle who vanished before Micah was born, he knew exactly where he had to go.
  
    \subsection{Background}
    Micah grew up in foster care, always knowing he was “sensitive” in a way that others weren’t. He’s spent time working at grief support groups, volunteering in spiritual communities, and studying dream psychology. He doesn’t talk much about his family—but he keeps a journal full of sketches and messages from dreams he hasn’t told anyone about.
  
    \subsection{Appearance}
    Micah wears layered, practical clothes—a denim jacket over a hoodie, worn boots, and a small crystal pendant. He often pauses mid-thought, distracted by something no one else noticed. His calm voice hides a deep current of unease.
  
    \subsection{Personality}
    Empathetic and soft-spoken, Micah avoids conflict but isn’t afraid of difficult truths. He’s open-minded, intuitive, and carries himself like someone used to not being believed. Despite everything, he genuinely wants to help others find peace—because he’s never quite known it himself.
  
    \subsection{Connection to the Monastery}
    Micah’s mother never spoke of her brother, but he appeared in Micah’s dreams for years. When the letter arrived in that uncle’s handwriting, Micah knew it wasn’t just a coincidence. Something old is calling to him—and he may be the only one who can hear it clearly.
  
    \subsection{Goals}
    Micah wants to understand what’s haunting the monastery—not just for his uncle’s sake, but to better understand his own strange connection to death and memory. If he can help others find peace, maybe he can find some of his own.

\begin{WyrdCharacterSheet}
    {Nina Maddox} 
    {“There’s always a reason. Even if you don’t like what it is.”}
  
    Nina Maddox doesn’t believe in ghosts. Or at least, she doesn’t admit to it. A freelance investigator with a background in private security, Nina specialises in cleaning up messes no one wants to admit exist. She’s not here because she believes in hauntings—she’s here because someone thought she should be.
  
    \subsection{Background}
    Nina served in law enforcement before moving into private security and missing persons work. She’s seen cults, hoaxes, and grieving families manipulated by con artists. When she got a letter from her estranged father—dead over a decade—she assumed it was a prank. Still, she couldn’t ignore the place it mentioned: Saint Hieronymus Monastery. She’d heard of it before, in the case files she was never supposed to read.
  
    \subsection{Appearance}
    Short-cropped hair, sharp eyes, and a lean, athletic build. Nina dresses in a leather jacket and cargo jeans, always carrying a duffel with tools, water, and a flashlight. She walks like someone who’s used to being underestimated—and making people regret it.
  
    \subsection{Personality}
    Blunt, sceptical, and resourceful. Nina doesn’t buy into rituals or spirits, but she respects grief—and she knows that sometimes, belief can be more dangerous than truth. She doesn’t scare easy, but what she finds at the monastery might just shake that.
  
    \subsection{Connection to the Monastery}
    Her father investigated Saint Hieronymus decades ago and never spoke of it again. His death was ruled a suicide. The letter bearing his handwriting simply said: \emph{“They never let me leave. Maybe you can.”}
  
    \subsection{Goals}
    Nina wants to find the source of the monastery’s silence and put it to rest—by force, if necessary. She doesn’t believe in ghosts, but she does believe in justice. And if there’s something still trapped there, it’s about to find out what she's made of.
