	]{Edward Mercer}
	
    \emph{A cunning blackmailer who underestimated the desperation of those he ensnared.}
    
    \subsubsection*{Background:}
    Edward Mercer was well-known in London’s underworld for his talent for unearthing dirty secrets and using them to his advantage. He approached his victims with a cold, calculated patience, squeezing them for all they were worth. His last target, however, proved more dangerous than he anticipated—Beatrice Langley, a woman with too much to lose. He was found dead in his private lounge at the Brass Orchid, the victim of a locked-room murder.
